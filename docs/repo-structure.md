## Notes

- Raw drone photos and processed imagery will likely be large binary files —
  consider Git LFS or keeping them out of git entirely (local/cloud storage
  with a pointer/README in assets/) once volume is known.
- `.godot/` (editor cache) and `*.import` files are gitignored — regenerated
  locally when the project is opened in the Godot editor.
- Textures the scene actually loads must live under `project/` — Godot's
  `res://` root is the `project/` directory and can't reach outside it (no
  `res://../assets`). `assets/` stays the place for source/raw material and
  anything not directly loaded by the engine; see D-7 in
  [decisions.md](project/decisions.md).
